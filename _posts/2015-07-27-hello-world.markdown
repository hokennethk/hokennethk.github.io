At the beginning of 2015, I decided to take the leap. Prior to 2015 I had been studying programming in my free time through various online-resources ([Udacity][udacity], [Coursera][coursera], [Codecademy][codecademy], etc). After a lot of learning, I started to entertain the thought of being able to do this kind of thing full-time. However, I felt that studying after work and on weekends was not getting me there.

Living in the Bay Area put me next to some coding bootcamps and software engineering career accelerators. After a lot of research (and studying), I began applications to a few. I interviewed and was accepted to both Maker Square and Hack Reactor in San Francisco, CA. In the end, I chose to attend [Hack Reactor][hr], where I've been studying for the past month. So far, I can say it has been quite the experience.

A lot has changed in the past half-year. I hope that with this blog I can chronicle my journey in learning programming. I also hope that this blog can serve as a resource to those new to learning to code.

Keep on coding!
