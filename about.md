Hi, I'm Kenneth.

I was born and raised in San Jose, CA. I went to school at UC San Diego, where I received a degree in Bioengineering.

I'm currently a student at Hack Reactor, a software engineering career accerlerator in San Francisco, CA.

I created this site to keep track of my own adventures in programming and to share what I've learned.

### Site

Based on [Kactus](https://github.com/nickbalestra/kactus) theme.
